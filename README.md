# conways-game-of-life

 An implementation of Conway's Game of Life written in C++ in sophomore year HS. I wrote this in one day as a challenge and I had a lot of fun. I also got interested in some of the patterns created via this game. My personal favorite is below: the arrangement in the first image becomes the second image after a few iterations, creating a stable, repeating pattern. I used SFML to render the graphics.
